    "If you want to include Search functionality on your docs site, you need to set up a [Google Custom Search](https://cse.google.com/cse/all) engine (click 'add' on this link to create one), and then link it to your `_config.yml`. In the following sections we've listed all the settings we used for search functionality in docs.fast.ai, since they will probably we a reasonable starting point for you too. Once you've created the custom search engine in Google, copy the \"search engine id\" and use it as the value for \"google_search\" in `docs/_config.yml`."
