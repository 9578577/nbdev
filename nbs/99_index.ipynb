Using the interactive enviromnent, you can easily debug and refactor your code. By simply adding `#export` flags to the cells that define the functions you want to keep, you can then convert your notebook in a standard python module with just one command in the console or one line of code at the end of your notebook:\n",

The basic structure (that can be personalized provided you change the relevant information in `settings.ini`) is a folder `nbs` for your notebooks, a folder `docs` where the doc will be auto-generated that contains everything for a [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)-powered website.\n",
